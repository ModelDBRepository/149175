The accompanying Java model file, smolenltp.java, runs tetanic,
theta-burst, and chemical late LTP simulations from

Smolen P, Baxter DA, Byrne JH (2006). A model of the roles of
essential kinases in the induction and expression of late long-term
potentiation.  Biophys J. 90(8):2760-75.

To compile and run this file, save as smolenltp.java. Then with java
compiler installed (e.g. JDK from Oracle), type "javac smolenltp.java"
to compile and "java smolenltp" to run. Output will be ASCII 2-column
text files which reproduces figures 3 - 6 of the paper.  The
PrintWriter statements at the start of the program give the names of
these files, they can be altered at will.
